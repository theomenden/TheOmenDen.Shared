# The Omen Den Shared Library

### This is just a grouping of common classes that are used within every application that The Omen Den aims to provide as a company, and is free to modify, redistribute, and use elsewhere
### Especially since this library is sure to not be unique to us.

## A grouping of classes that aims to provide:

### Relevant extensions accross The Omen Den's software applications
### Exception calling, and custom exceptions
### Pooling extensions for Stringbuilder and Arrays
### Robust Api Services
### Custom Enumerations (both standard, and "smart")
### Base Record types for QueryStrings and Events
